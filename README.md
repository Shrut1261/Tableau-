# Insights into ICPC World Finals Performance (1999–2024)

## Introduction
The **International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)** is the most prestigious global programming competition for university students. Every year, teams of three students from universities worldwide compete to solve challenging algorithmic problems under strict time constraints. Beyond being a competition, ICPC serves as a **platform for fostering innovation, teamwork, and problem-solving skills**, offering a valuable measure of the academic and technical capabilities of participating universities.

This report analyzes **ICPC World Finals performance trends from 1999 to 2024**, highlighting **regional dominance, medal distributions, and participation growth**. Using **Tableau** as the primary visualization tool, this project presents a **comprehensive analysis** of university participation, historical performance, and evolving competitive landscapes in global programming education.
